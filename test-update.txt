considerate basic git command:
- git clone (url of ssh repo) = fetch repo to local
- git push / push origin main = uploading to github repo

- git add . (dot means all) = staging
- git commit -m "massage or notes to the commit" = sending to branch

- git status = see files modified/ added
- git log = basically commands history
